The is a basic starting theme that is designed to take advantage of the twitter bootstrap options in JojoCMS.


Requirements
============

This theme is only compatable with the current bootstrap branch of the JojoCMS
https://github.com/JojoCMS/Jojo-CMS/tree/bootstrap

Things to note but using on a live site:
========================================

1) When installing this theme, it will turn on all of the twitter bootstrap options. It is recommended that you turn off any bootstrap option that you don't wish as it will help with site performance

2) The theme has a custom version of Modernizr. This is basically a full dump of the entire project. It is recommended that you visit the Modernizr Download page and build a custom build and substitute it in.
